## üìä Model Comparison & Results

| Metric                | Logistic Regression | XGBoost Model      | Improvement                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Recall (Fraud)**    | 0.90 (90%)          | **0.86 (86%)**     | Slight decrease (missed 4 more frauds)      |
| **Precision (Fraud)** | 0.10 (10%)          | **0.71 (71%)**     | **Massive 7.1x increase!**                  |
| **False Positives**   | 793                 | **34**             | **Dramatic Reduction (~23x fewer FPs!)**    |
| **False Negatives**   | 10                  | 14                 | Slight increase (missed 4 more frauds)      |
| **ROC AUC**           | 0.91                | **0.98**           | Significant improvement                     |
| **Avg Precision**     | 0.7175 (~0.7)       | **0.87**           | **Huge improvement!**                       |

‚úÖ The XGBoost model achieves **a strong balance** between recall and precision, significantly reducing false positives while maintaining high fraud detection.
